## Week 1 Summary
This week our team started implementing the algorithms parsing and creating classes. 

**jcsong3** was in charge of parsing the input data files from the OpenFlights. He created classes for airports and routes which are going to make use of
 implementing map of airports and the connect edges between them. 
 
**jinyud2** was in charge of implementing the BFS algorithm. The inputs are the graph and one node and traverse all the nodes to return a vector of string that 
contains the related nodes of the input node. She also implemented a helper function that get one specific node's directly related node.

**byim3** implemented the Great Circle Distance algorithm which could help us to calculate the distance between two airports by the given latitude and longitude. 
This algorithm also helps us to calculate weight of edges of our graph.

## Week 2 summary  
**jcsong3**  Created the maps class which serves as the main graph for the project

**jinyud2** implemented a helper function that get one specific node's directly related node.

**byim3** worked on implementing the maps class along with jcsong3 which serves as the main graph for the project.

**ishank3** started the betweenness centrality algorithm and Dijkstras algorithm. The betweenness centrality algorithm could help us to find the centrality degree for each airport and Dijkstras help us find the shortest route between the source airport and the destination.


## Week 3 summary 
**jcsong3** rewirte the map class and made sure the parsing worked successfully. Also wrote tests and the output achieved the desired outcome.

**jinyud2** helped debuging the parsing part. Then she revised some variables and function call in BFS algorithm to make it match with the existing parsing files. In addition, she created sample data files and made test cases. So far, all tests passed.

**byim3** helped jcsong3 revising parsing part and started working on betweenness centrality algorithm.

**ishank3** added more features in map.cpp and debugged parsing part to help BFS and Dijkstras algorithms working. He also finished implementing Dijkstras algorithm. Now he starts working on betweenness centrality part.

## Week 4 summary 
**jcsong3** finished up the betweenness centrality algorithm and implemented it within other classes. Wrote tests for the parsing functions and fixed minor bugs along the way. Added correct style comments for header files. Worked on read me details and helped put together presentation slides. Tidyed up everything for the final deliverable.

**ishank3** helped finish up betweenness centrality algorithm and wrote tests for the Dijkstra class. Added comments in Dijkstra.h, worked on read me and the presentation slide as well as the video.

**byim3** edited our video and created graphics for it. also helped out with CMakeLists, Betweenness Centrality, worked on presentation slides, and helped debugging

**jinyud2** Added more test cases in BFS and helped adding some of the parsing test. Added some comments and deleted some useless comments to make the code more readable. Created README, slides and result file.
